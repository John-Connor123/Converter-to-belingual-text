     This program make a Bilingual text from English text and it doesn't need a transcription.
    Just put your file to a directory where program is and answer in questions in console.
    My program do all other work.
    
     Program works with txt, epub, fb2 formats. 
    But if your file has a fb2 format you should choose your file in the folder window which will open later.
    
     Output file has a name 'Bilingual_(input file name).docx'. 
    File with only transcribed text and replace settings are temp. You can delete package Temp_file if you don't need it.
